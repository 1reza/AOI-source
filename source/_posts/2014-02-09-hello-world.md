This is my first post in english and i’m newbie :| , so if there is some mistakes please forgive me.

My name is Reza Ranjbar, Im 32 and single. I born and grown up in iran as a muslim, But not anymore :|

I’m a gamer, i have a ps3 and `Killzone1-3`. `killzone1` actually is a ps2 game but with `ps3-classic` you can run it on ps3.

I love linux, i’m not expert but i’m learning. [Ubuntu][] was my first distro like most of iranian and now i’m using [Archlinux][] with Openbox :/

[archlinux]: http://www.archlinux.org "Arch linux"
[ubuntu]: http://www.ubuntu.com "Ubuntu"
